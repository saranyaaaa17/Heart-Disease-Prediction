# Heart Disease Prediction â€“ ML Internship Project

Hey there! This is a machine learning project I completed as part of my ML internship from Internshala. The goal was to build a model that can predict whether someone is likely to have heart disease based on their health and lifestyle data.

## About the Dataset

The original dataset details were shared in a PDF, so I recreated the data from scratch using the given structure. It includes features like:

- Age (in days, later converted to years)
- Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol and Glucose levels
- Smoking, Alcohol use, and Physical activity
- Height, Weight, Gender
- Target variable: `disease` (1 = has heart disease, 0 = no disease)

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## What I Did

- Recreated the dataset using Python
- Cleaned and explored the data (EDA)
- Preprocessed features (scaling, encoding, etc.)
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualized results with confusion matrix and charts

## What I Learned

This project really helped me understand how to:
- Work with structured health data
- Handle preprocessing steps manually
- Train and evaluate classification models
- Break down a project from raw data to insights

## Next Steps

Iâ€™m planning to try out other models like Random Forest and SVM, and maybe deploy the model for predictions in a small app.
